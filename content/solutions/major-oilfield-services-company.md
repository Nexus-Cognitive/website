## Solution

Develop a production, engineering focused, asset workflow solution that creates actionable knowledge from vast amounts of valuable internal and external data.

- clearly defined, evaluated and selected the high priority data
- planned a roadmap for the way forward to acquire, correlate, manage and visualize the data
- transformed the data to information and knowledge, which required analysis and planning for the integration (connectors) to discrete applications and tools essential to the asset workflow
- included the following applications and tools:
  - Geologic Models
  - Drilling and Hydraulics models
  - Petrophysics models
  - Fracturing Models
  - Visualization tools
  - Static and dynamic reservoir models

## Results

- Developed a solution that the <abbr title="Chief Operating Officer">COO</abbr> said “maximized well productivity for our global client base thus, driving revenue and profitability”
- Combined structured and unstructured data sources, transforming disparate data into information and knowledge
- Enabled on-site analysis of historic data from comparable jobs against data being encountered real-time while in drilling or treatment operations, adding significantly to the value our customer could deliver to its customers. This resulted in a complete paradigm shift on the end customer’s view of the services available from our customer.
