> **Rapidly delivering a $1.5 Bn annual transaction marketplace in 4.5 months.**

**Problem**

The largest non-profit Public School Board Association (PSBA) operates a purchasing cooperative serving over 8,000 public school districts and government agencies. The cooperative was facing an increasingly competitive environment from commercial operators offering a more sophisticated online marketplace experience.   The existing web application was developed internally on the Microsoft Platform over ten years prior, with platform performance beginning to degrade as demand increases.

**Solution**

After a two-month rapid analysis and design phase we determined the existing platform required building a reimagined cloud-based eCommerce platform. Due to the unique combination of regulatory compliance requirements and diversity of service offerings across over 4,000 vendors a custom marketplace solution was required.

 A Nexus team of experienced Azure architects, analysts, engineers, and designers analyzed existing capabilities while determining optimal platform architecture and technologies. 

* Azure SQL Database Services
* Azure Web Apps
* Azure PowerBI Embedded Analytics 
* Azure Cognitive Search
* Azure Dev Ops

Applying our Cloud Acceleration Framework allowed Nexus to complete cloud modernization and migrate to a production environment in under 4.5 months. This efficient migration allowed the client to take advantage of the back-to-school season, a key business driver.

### **Outcomes**

* #### Rapid (4.5 months) delivery of online marketplace running on 100% Azure PaaS supporting over $1.5 Billion in transaction volume and 400k purchase orders.
* #### Punchout integration to support real-time purchase order and requisition transmission from customer ERP.
* #### New digital Marketplace user experience driving new monthly volume highs (+40%)
