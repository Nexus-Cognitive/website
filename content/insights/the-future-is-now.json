In the past decade, the deluge of big data has wrought a vast transformation of the IT landscape. Predictive analytics has become common-place. New technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) promise to change the way we approach analytics and decision-making. Additionally, the pressure the gain efficiencies, connect more intimately with suppliers and customers, and increase top and bottom line revenue to maximize shareholder value has made it imperative to respond more quickly to market changes.\n\nSo how will companies deal with these pressures? The ones who thrive—not just survive—in the future will have three characteristics: intelligence, connectedness, and agility.##They will be intelligent\n\nOver the past 25 years, business intelligence and analytics technologies have revolutionized business decision-making. However, it’s not enough anymore to simply buy BI or analytics tools, load your data, slice and dice it, and interpret the results. Big data has made traditional tools almost obsolete—especially for large, complex, or multi-national companies. In five years, the analytics technologies in play will have undergone a profound change, and that change is already underway.\n\nArtificial intelligence is the future of analytics. Retailers are already adopting AI technologies for deep learning to manage customer interactions and increase customer satisfaction. In fact, Garner predicts that by 2020, 85% of all customer interactions will be managed by AI technologies.\n\nAI-augmented analytics can be applied to nearly every industry and sector. For example, financial institutions can use it for fraud detection, portfolio optimization, and customer service. Agricultural concerns can use AI to improve research on farming methods, manage crop yields, minimize the use of pesticides, and manage livestock. In healthcare, AI can help doctors diagnose diseases faster and more accurately, help researchers find cures for those diseases, and it can help health systems manage costs and patient populations more effectively while providing optimized care.",
