**DENVER, May 5, 2022 (Newswire.com) -** Nexus Cognitive is pleased to announce the acquisition of Salos Services, a Business Intelligence as a Service firm. Headquartered out of Golden, Colorado, Salos Services helps companies leverage their data and processes for greater efficiency through managed Business Intelligence (BI) services. Nexus' *EZ Analytics* is the rebranded Salos product that leverages proprietary Intellectual Property (IP) to provide actionable intelligence 

"We are excited to combine Salos Services' and Nexus Cognitive's capabilities. We look forward to growing Salos' repeatable solutions as it aligns with our mission of eliminating technical debt based on a legacy of poor architectural decisions," said Anu Jain, CEO of Nexus Cognitive. 

Barrett Johnson and Jason Herron, founders and owners of Salos Services, are excited about the merger and the opportunities it will provide to new and existing clients by combining the strengths of each company. "Salos was a very niche data analytics firm," Herron says. "But now, with Nexus and the suite of capabilities, we have more than we can offer our existing clients and new prospects."

"What we do is the foundation - understanding their business, and understanding their challenges with their data," Johnson says. "It's now our foot in the door, and once we start building their business intelligence platform, these added Nexus capabilities become more valuable."

EZ Analytics provides a quick return on investment by immediately analyzing areas where clients are losing money and experiencing challenges. A minimum viable product with actionable insights and solutions can be delivered within 4-8 weeks.

"It's fast, and it's simple," Herron says. "We try not to put too much complexity around our designs and how we implement them with our customers. It's fast in the sense that we have developed software that can connect quickly to source systems and move that data into a central data repository, and then start putting reporting on top of that."

"Adding Salos' depth of technical expertise and breadth of industry experience combined with the EZ Analytics was a no-brainer," said Andrew Nardo, CTO, Nexus Cognitive.
