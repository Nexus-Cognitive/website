The last 4 years saw a massive migration to the cloud with enterprises signed up by the thousands for flexible, large–scale computing and data storage. This new environment led to a broad ecosystem of vendor platforms and custom solutions to collect, retrieve, and analyze huge amounts of data. Firms realized ROI, however, in most cases these systems are siloed driving up cost, duplication, and complexity — without providing broad insight across the enterprise.

For example, many firms are forced to maintain two types of analytical systems, data warehouses and data lakes. Data lakes can uncover important signals on customers, products, employees, and processes. Data warehouses provide critical insights on business health. These systems meet critical needs, yet operate independently of one another, which can lead to uninformed decisions. At the same time, businesses need to unlock new insights across all data while avoiding duplication and a providing reliable single source of truth for each key data point.

Last week, at its Ignite conference in Orlando, Florida, Microsoft announced Azure Synapse Analytics, a new service that merges the capabilities of Azure SQL Data Warehouse with new enhancements such as on-demand query as a service. Three exciting capability areas include:

Centralized Insights: Provides the hub to facilitate integration across all data sources, data warehouses and big data analytics systems. This focus on providing an engine to drive insight across the enterprise data sources is compelling.

Unified Experience: build end-to-end analytics solutions with a unified experience. The Azure Synapse studio provides a unified workspace for data prep, data management, data warehousing, big data, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) tasks.
Powerful Insights / AI: Deeply integration with Power BI and Azure Machine Learning will greatly expand the discovery of insights across all your data and apply machine learning models to all your intelligent apps. Significantly reduce project development time for business intelligence and machine learning projects with a limitless analytics service
According to MSFT, Synapse is the first and only analytics system to have run all TPC-H queries at petabyte-scale. They also emphasized it is designed to support the increasingly popular DevOps strategy, in which development and operations staff collaborate more closely to create and implement services that work better throughout their lifecycles.

If you are assessing your data integration/aggregation strategy, [Azure Synapse Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/synapse-analytics/) is worth a look.
